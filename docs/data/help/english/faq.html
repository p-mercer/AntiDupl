<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions.

<ul>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
The program created a huge list of duplicates after checking.
They are almost all exactly the same. 
How do I remove them faster?
 </i></p><p align="justify">
I recommend you the following sequence of actions:
 <ul type = "circle">
  <li><p align="justify">
Select all the results by pressing <b>Ctrl-A</b>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
Click the button <b>Perform the recommendations of the computer</b> <img src="../../resources/images/PerformHintButton.img" />  on the 
<a href="index.html?page=toolbar.html" target="_top">Toolbar</a>. 
  </p></li>
 </ul>
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
I gathered a large collection of pictures and periodically add new there. 
After each addition of pictures I run your program to avoid duplicates.
Pictures are scanned every time again a fairly long time. 
How can I speed up this process?
 </i></p><p align="justify">
First, check whether you have enabled option <b>Remember images</b>,
which is located on the <b>Advanced</b> tag of the <a href="index.html?page=options.html" target="_top">Options Window</a>. 
It significantly accelerates the process of re-search.
In addition, folders with images that you previously checked, and which do not contain new pictures
you must add to the list located on the <b>Valid</b> tag of the <a href="index.html?page=paths.html" target="_top">Paths Window</a>.
Then these pictures will not be compared with each other, which also accelerates the time of re-search.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
The files with GIF-animation have a many frames. How do you compare these files? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
The comparison is performed on the first frame of the sequence.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
I was completely satisfied by the functionality of the program.
But I do not like the icons that are used in the program.
Are you going to improve the interface?
 </i></p><p align="justify">
Unfortunately, I am a programmer, but not a designer.
I was painting icons as I could.
If you have the ability and desire, you can replace the standard icons.
They are located in the directory <b>data\resources\images</b> in the files with the extension <b>*.img</b>.
In fact, this is standard PNG-images.
If you manage to create a better version of the icons then send it to me and I will be pleased to place them on the site.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
I am a programmer too and would like to ask what language is written your program. 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
The core program is written in C++, its shell in C#.
More information about the history of its creation can be read <a href="index.html?page=history.html" target="_top">here</a>.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
Why, when I add drive D to the search path, no search is performed? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
In Windows disks are system directories. 
Therefore, in order that a program can implement a search there, you must enable the option <b>Search system folders/files</b>,
which is located on the tab <b>Search</b> in <a href="index.html?page=options.html" target="_top">Options Window</a>.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
How does the program makes recommendations to remove duplicate files? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
If a duplicate pair of images in the same format, but the difference is less than half of the threshold image difference,
the program recommends to remove the image, which has the smaller the size of picture and/or smaller file size.
If the program will meet two identical images, then it will recommend to remove the one
which is located in the <a href="index.html?page=paths.html" target="_top">Remove Paths</a>.
If a picture with better quality will be in the directory to delete, the program recommends move it to place of picture in the normal directory.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
Why you did not translate the program into my native language? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
Unfortunately, I know only Russian and English.
However, you have the opportunity to translate the program into their native language. 
To do so, you need create your own version of the file string resources in xml-format and put it to the directory <b>data\resources\strings</b>.
If you send me your translation, then I will be able to include it into the standard version of the program and place on my site.  
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
How do I get a list of the results in text format? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
Select list of results with using key combination <b>Ctrl-A</b>.
Copy to clipboard with using key combination <b>Ctrl-C</b>.
Then copy it into your text file with using key combination <b>Ctrl-V</b>.
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
How do I check whether has this picture duplicates in the given directory? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
You need to do the following steps:
 <ul type = "circle">
  <li><p align="justify">
Add the image and the directory in which you want to perform search, into <a href="index.html?page=paths.html" target="_top">paths</a> <b>Search</b>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
Disable the option <b>Check - Compare images from one path with one another</b>, placed into <a href="index.html?page=options.html" target="_top">search options</a>. 
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
Start the search.
  </p></li>
 </ul>
 </p></li>
 <li><p align="justify"><i>
Could you briefly describe the algorithm for image comparison, which is used in your program? 
 </i></p><p align="justify">
In simplified form, my algorithm of image comparison comprises the following steps:
 <ul type = "circle">
  <li><p align="justify">
Resizing all the images to the same size (by default, this size is 32x32).
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
The discarding the color information (conversion to grayscale image).
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
The finding of mean square differences for each pair of reduced grayscale images.
  </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">
Comparison of the mean square difference with threshold - if the difference is less than the threshold, it is supposed that these images are similar.
  </p></li>
 </ul>
 </p></li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
If you do not find in this list answers to your questions, it is recommended to look at
<a href="http://antidupl.sourceforge.net/english/index.html" target="_top">site</a> of the program, as well as its
<a href="http://antidupl.livejournal.com" target="_top">journal</a> (in Russian).
There you can ask your question, and I will answer it as quickly as possible.
